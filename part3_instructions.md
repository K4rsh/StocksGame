# Project Overview

This semester's project will be implementation of a stock trading game as a web application with a server portion and an browser/HTML front end.  Players will compete to see whose pretend trading portfolio has the highest value at the end of the game/competition. You only have to support sell and buy actions, no other advanced trading actions are needed in the game/simulation.

Your server/application will have to support the following features:
* register players for the game
* provide all players a starting cash account in their portfolio
* allow player buy and sell actions at the current NYSE prices
* keep track of each player's portfolio and its value
* declare a winner at the end of the game
* maintain player login and profile information
* admin users that can create games

Your application will support additional features of your own choice, such as:
* optional viewing of competitor's portfolios
* optional costs to buy/sell transactions (fees)
* tracking all trades and activities of a player during the game
* time and starting amount game configuration
* and other features you should come up with

You should also consider any features you may not be able to implement, but would make good extensions to your app: for example, advanced charting and analysis of stock performance.

# Part III (due Apr 5, 2024)

Complete your project by finishing any work remaining from part II and implementing a client/browser side for the application.

Complete a 3 to 5 minute video demonstrating to the marker how to operate each feature using the client GUI/web site. The video should not be submitted via the repo, since it will be a large file. Use a cloud service or some other means to deliver your video demo and give the link tro your video in your repo README file.

You may alter the server and change the API calls used from part II. You may decide not to use some calls, and to implement or alter others.

Revise your README file from part II to reflect any of the changes made to complete the project.

The README should also contain the following information:

* location of the demo video
* any information needed to configure and run your project
* the database and collection names used (so they can be deleted after using your project)
* the status of the project: list which features are working (or partially working) and which are not working. 
* Indication of the API calls and unit tests associated with each feature should be updated from part II submission.

Push the project submission elements (except for the video) to the project repo before the deadline. 

Evaluation scheme for this submission will be available separately.
